# Web_Scraper_for_News_Articles
Create a Web Scraper using python to scrap the content, title and last update date of news article

Since I've tested this code on two websites --- Washington post and The hindu

It worked perfectly fine

But if you want to scrap different News websites and if this code doesn't work then you can remove the author name and update date, rest of the file works
And if you also want author name with last update date and time then I can help you.
